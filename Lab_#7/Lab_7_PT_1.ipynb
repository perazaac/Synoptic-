    "In this tutorial, we are going to create Skew-<i>T</i>, ln-<i>p</i> diagrams at specific locations using observation data to aid in inferring horizontal temperature advection (from thermal-wind principles). Luckily, MetPy has functionality to make plotting Skew-<i>T</i>, ln-<i>p</i> diagrams easy rather than us having to build these diagrams (particularly their skewed axes) from scratch.\n",
