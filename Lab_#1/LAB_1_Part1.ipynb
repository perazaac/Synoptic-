There are column names and row names for the table that we can use to access various parts of the data.  With the way that MetPy structures it's parser the row names are the name of the station, and the column names are the observation variable names.  This structure is useful because sometimes when working with METAR data we need to get an observation for a single location.  In the code below I use the pandas' syntax to get O'Hare airport's observation rows in our sample file.  Multiple times may appear since O'Hare may make multiple observations during the hour that the data is for. <br />\n"
